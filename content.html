	RIGHT - Hello! My name is Diedra, and I’m an artist learning to program!
	</div>


	<div class="row" id="second">
	LEFT - As far back as I can remember, I’ve always loved making things. I like to write, sew, knit, bead-weave, draw, and paint. But, although I loved the process of making my ideas into reality, I was always frustrated that my creations did not make a difference in the world. One thing I love about code is that it can solve real problems.

	RIGHT - [example painting (Nine of Swords) or link to artist portfolio. latter is probably preferable because it shows yet another example of my coding projects, which could be noted in a subtitle under the icon. or maybe I should use three columns and have both or a link to my portfolio and a sample of my work that isn’t on the site like my sheep study or self-portrait]

	<div class="row" id="third">
	LEFT - [icon + link to Learn Hanzi]

	RIGHT - I love the idea of making software that helps people learn. In particular, I would like to make it easier for people to learn new languages so we can break down cultural barriers and solve problems together. That’s why I made Learn Hanzi!, a spaced-repetition flashcards app that teaches the user Chinese radicals.

	<div class="row" id="fourth">
	LEFT - I’m really excited about the prospect of working with a team to create a project. In April I attended my first hackathon, hosted by the Women Who Code Silicon Valley chapter [link to meetup event page? http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Silicon-Valley/events/192024092/ ]. My team used Meteor and Bootstrap to make Animal Rescue, a site where people can find animals to adopt or people to adopt animals that need a home. We had a great time, made a functional prototype in just one day, and even won 2nd place.
